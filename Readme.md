## About
* This repository contains code for different data structures and algorithms implemented majorly in C and C++.
* From my experience I am sharing a learning path which a newbie could follow to master Datastructures and Algorithms.
* It's not a one day task but you will have to practice daily to develop a good grasp at DSA.
 
## Getting Started
### Level-1
* Learn any one programming language. 
* Learn basic concepts of oops, which will help you during the implementation part of DSA.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is one of the best website from where you can learn step by step.
* Learn some basics of algorithms like what is time and space complexity.

### Level-2
* Watch all the videos of [Mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P).
* Try to implement side by side, and read some articles on [GFG](https://geeksforgeeks.org/) for the topics which you don't understand in single run.
