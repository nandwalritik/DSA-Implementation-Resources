## About
* This repository contains code for different data structures and algorithms implemented majorly in C and C++.
* From my experience I am sharing a learning path which a newbie could follow to master Datastructures and Algorithms.
* It's not a one day task but you will have to practice daily to develop a good grasp at DSA.
 
## Getting Started
### Level-1
* Learn any one programming language. 
* Learn basic concepts of oops, which will help you during the implementation part of DSA.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is one of the best website from where you can learn step by step.
* Learn some basics of algorithms like what is time and space complexity.

### Level-2
* Watch all the videos of [Mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P).
* Try to implement side by side, and read some articles on [GFG](https://geeksforgeeks.org/) for the topics which you don't understand in single run. 

### Level-3
* For mastering trees watch Tushar Roy's [Trees](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmLmBdmIlpv_jNDXtJGYTPNQ2L1gdHxu) playlist, solve similar questions on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
* For solving important interview questions on Datastructures, watch [Aditya Verma's](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdityaVermaTheProgrammingLord) stack,binary-search,recusrssion and heap playlist.
* Learn Algorithms theory from [Abdul Bari Sir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O).

### Level-4
* Last and the most Important topics which every programmer suffers learning! Graph and Dynamic Programming.
* For DP watch Aditya Verma's [DP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go) playlist, the way he has explained, will help you to approach almost every new problem you will see on DP.
* For graph I never followed any specific resource, but I mostly learned them from [cpalgorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/#:~:text=O(Nlog%20N)-,Graphs,-Graph%20traversal) and [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)
