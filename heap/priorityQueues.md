Ascending Priority queue 	: smallest key , highest priority
Descending Priority queue 	: largest key , highest priority
 In priority queues we insert data with key to the priority queue(because elements are ordered based on key)
 
 
Heap Sort : Sorts the elements in the elements in the priority queue based on priority(key).
 
 
 Priority Queue applications(Important):-
 	Data compression				: Huffman Coding algorithm
	Shortest path algorithms		: Dijkstra’s algorithm
	Minimum spanning tree algorithms: Prim’s algorithm
	Event-driven simulation			: customers in a line
	Selection problem				: Finding k th - smallest element
